# Customer Churn MLOps Pipeline

This project implements an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for customer churn prediction
using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## Objectives
- Train and evaluate a churn prediction model
- Deploy the model via a REST API
- Monitor model performance and data drift
- Automate retraining when performance degrades

## Tech Stack
- Python, Scikit-learn
- FastAPI
- Docker
- GitHub Actions
- MLflow
- Evidently
- Airflow (retraining orchestration)
